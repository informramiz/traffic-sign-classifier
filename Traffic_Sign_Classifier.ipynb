After looking at traffic sign data set count I thought my system will be good with Adam as optimizer and I have to do less hyper parameter fine tuning. That’s why Adam was my first choice. \n",

CNNs are well suited for images input and weight sharing is well suited when we need translation invariance. \n",

    "All convolutional layers were taken from LeNet-5 architecture from the lab with exactly same parameters (number of neurons/weights etc.) as I thought (also recommended in project notebook) it will be a good starting point.

For example I got a little bit improved accuracy when I set the batch_size = 150-200 or the learning rate=0.0001 or epochs=15. Results were better with batch size=150-200 (I did not tried above that), epochs=13-15 and learning rate=0.001\n",
